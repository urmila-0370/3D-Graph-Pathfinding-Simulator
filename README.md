## Overview
This project implements multiple graph pathfinding algorithms in Python on a 3D graph dataset. Algorithms included are BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*, and Minimum Spanning Tree, enabling shortest path and optimized traversal simulations.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in modules: `math`, `heapq`, `json`, `random`
- Data structures: Graphs, Queues, Stacks, Heaps

## Features
- Find shortest paths between arbitrary 3D points.
- Visualizes graph traversal using simulated paths (via coordinates).
- Multiple algorithm support for comparison and testing.
